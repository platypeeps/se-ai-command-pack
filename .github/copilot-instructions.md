# Trellis Review Guidance

When reviewing a Trellis-enabled repository:

- Treat Trellis-generated runtime and platform payloads as copied integration files in consumer repositories. Examples include `.trellis/scripts/**`, `.trellis/agents/**`, `.trellis/workflow.md`, and platform Trellis files under `.agents/**`, `.claude/**`, `.codex/**`, `.cursor/**`, `.gemini/**`, `.github/**`, `.opencode/**`, `.qoder/**`, `.codebuddy/**`, `.factory/**`, `.pi/**`, `.reasonix/**`, `.trae/**`, and `.zcode/**`.
- Do not leave line-by-line style, wording, or local refactor comments on those copied files unless the PR explicitly changes Trellis integration, the copied file is the primary subject, it leaks secrets, it has syntax or wiring breakage, or it contradicts the PR goal.
- If a Trellis-generated file needs a behavior change, leave one handoff comment asking for an upstream Trellis fix. Include the affected path, expected behavior, observed evidence or reproduction steps, and why the fix belongs upstream.
- Continue reviewing repo-owned `.trellis/spec/**`, `.trellis/tasks/**`, application code, migrations, tests, docs, and non-Trellis scripts normally.
- Group duplicate root-cause findings into one comment and point to a deterministic local check when one already covers the issue class.

## Trellis And SD AI Command Pack Review Guidance

- Trellis is the repository workflow foundation; the SD AI Command Pack adds
  Software Delivery command wrappers, local review tooling, post-merge
  housekeeping, and update-spec knowledge refreshes on top of it. Repo-local
  entry points: `.trellis/workflow.md`, `.agents/skills/sd-*/SKILL.md`, and
  `docs/SD_AI_COMMAND_PACK.md`.
- Treat copied-in Trellis and SD AI command pack payloads as vendored files:
  do not comment on their wording, style, examples, or implementation details
  unless the PR explicitly changes that integration, the copied file is the
  primary subject, it leaks a secret, breaks obvious syntax or repository
  wiring, or directly contradicts the PR's stated tooling goal. Copied
  payloads match these families:
  <!-- narrow-globs: skip - cross-platform generated payload families include optional platform anchors. -->
  - `.trellis/scripts/**` and `.trellis/agents/**`
  - `**/skills/trellis-*/**` and `**/skills/sd-*/**` under `.agents/`,
    `.agent/`, `.claude/`, `.codebuddy/`, `.codex/`, `.cursor/`, `.devin/`,
    `.factory/`, `.gemini/`, `.github/`, `.kiro/`, `.kilocode/`,
    `.opencode/`, `.pi/`, `.qoder/`, `.reasonix/`, and `.trae/`
  - Trellis and `sd` command, prompt, or workflow files under
    `.agent/workflows/`, `.claude/commands/`, `.codebuddy/commands/`,
    `.cursor/commands/`, `.devin/workflows/`, `.factory/commands/`,
    `.gemini/commands/`, `.github/prompts/` (including `continue.prompt.md` and `finish-work.prompt.md`),
    `.kilocode/workflows/`,
    `.opencode/commands/`, `.pi/prompts/`, `.qoder/commands/`,
    `.trae/commands/`, and `.zcode/commands/`
  - `.github/copilot/**`, `.github/hooks/trellis.json`, and
    `.github/agents/trellis-*`; platform hook/agent payloads under
    `.codebuddy/`, `.factory/`, `.qoder/`, `.trae/`, `.zcode/agents/`, and
    legacy `.zcode/cli/agents/`
  - `scripts/sd-ai-command-pack-*`, legacy `scripts/trellis-*.sh`, and
    `scripts/update_repomix*`
  - The `.gito/`, `.prism/`, and `.sd-ai-command-pack/` directories,
    `docs/SD_AI_COMMAND_PACK.md`, and legacy `docs/TRELLIS_REVIEW_PR_PACK.md`
- Original Trellis-owned runtime/template copies are not valid modification
  targets for target-repo or sd-ai-command-pack PRs, and should not be reviewed
  line by line. Treat diffs in upstream Trellis-owned surfaces such as
  <!-- narrow-globs: skip - optional Trellis-owned payload locations may not exist in every repo. -->
  `.trellis/scripts/**`, `.trellis/agents/**`, and platform `trellis-*` skills,
  agents, commands, prompts, workflows, hooks, and settings as ownership/scope
  issues. This does not apply to repo-owned `.trellis/spec/**` guidance or
  `.trellis/tasks/**` task documents. If a change appears needed, leave one
  handoff comment instead:
  ```text
  Handoff for sd-ai-command-pack source session:
  A change appears needed in original Trellis-owned runtime/template files,
  which should not be edited in the consumer repo copy.
  Affected file(s): <paths>
  Desired behavior: <short behavior>
  Evidence/repro: <commands, review finding, or failure>
  Please decide whether this belongs in an sd-ai-command-pack wrapper/template,
  a pack-owned guard, or an upstream Trellis change, then implement the durable
  source-owned fix.
  ```
- Spend review budget on app behavior, data contracts,
  data/access/security boundaries, migrations and rollback behavior, token or
  invitation fail-closed behavior, tests, operator-facing documentation, and
  repo-owned scripts.
- Before reviewing generated, copied, Trellis workspace, repository-map, or
  pack files, look for a `Tooling/generated scope:` section in the PR body.
  Broad automation or CI diffs use `Automation scope:` or `CI/review scope:`;
  repos add categories via `.sd-ai-command-pack/pr-body-scope.json`. If the
  matching section is missing, request it once instead of scattering scope
  comments across files.
- Group duplicate root causes into one comment. When deterministic local checks
  already cover a repeated issue class, point at the failing check once instead
  of repeating inline findings; if the check is missing or fragile, ask for one
  focused fixture in the local guard suite.
- Separate current, non-outdated unresolved findings from
  stale or outdated review threads. Treat copied or generated payloads as
  source and sync-contract review surfaces, not style-review surfaces.
- On pack refresh PRs (typically titled
  `refresh sd-ai-command-pack to <version>`), the vendored payload was
  reviewed upstream in the
  sd-ai-command-pack repository before release; review this repo's
  integration (PR metadata, repo-owned files, wiring) rather than
  re-reviewing the vendored file contents line by line.
