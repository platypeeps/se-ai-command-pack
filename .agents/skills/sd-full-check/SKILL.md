# SD Full Check

Run this project-local skill for `sd-full-check` and `/sd:full-check` style
work. It is an optional but strongly recommended PR-readiness gate, not an
every-edit requirement.

The canonical implementation is:

```bash
bash scripts/sd-ai-command-pack-toolchain.sh doctor
bash scripts/sd-ai-command-pack-full-check.sh
```

Run the toolchain doctor once and retain its selected Python and project-check
report. The doctor does not execute inferred project checks. If the helper is
missing, report that the pack should be reinstalled instead of trying raw
interpreters in sequence. Route dependency-sensitive ad hoc Python checks
through `bash scripts/sd-ai-command-pack-toolchain.sh run-python
--require-module <name> -- <arguments>`.

## What It Does

The script runs:

1. `git diff --check` for unstaged changes.
2. `git diff --cached --check` for staged changes.
3. Repo-local review preflight through
   `SD_AI_COMMAND_PACK_FULL_CHECK_REVIEW_PREFLIGHT_COMMAND` when configured, or
   through `scripts/check-review-preflight.mjs` when that Node.js script exists.
4. Copied/generated tooling scope checks for Trellis/SD AI command pack, known
   repository-map files when present, and Trellis workspace journal/index
   changes.
5. Structural post-install audit through
   `scripts/sd-ai-command-pack-install-audit.py`, verifying that copied pack
   targets match `.sd-ai-command-pack/installed-targets.txt`.
6. Configurable PR-body scope checks for generated/tooling, automation, and
   CI/review diffs, plus any repo-added categories in
   `.sd-ai-command-pack/pr-body-scope.json`.
7. Current-diff CI classification reporting through
   `scripts/classify-ci-changes.sh` when that script exists.
8. Optional package-script checks when `package.json`, Node.js, and the
   selected package runner are available. The default script-name probe looks
   for common entries: `typecheck`, `lint`, `test:unit`, `test:integration`,
   `build`, and `test:e2e`.
9. Prism local review when `prism` is on `PATH` and Prism is not disabled.
   When tracked staged or unstaged changes exist, review each non-empty local
   layer and skip the committed branch range; otherwise, review that range.
10. Gito review only when explicitly enabled.

## Safety Rules

- Do not stage, commit, push, or edit files as part of this skill unless the
  user separately asks for fixes.
- Treat failures as evidence to report and fix in the normal Trellis
  implementation flow.
- Prism is optional by default because some environments lack provider
  credentials or valid provider/model configuration. Set
  `SD_AI_COMMAND_PACK_FULL_CHECK_PRISM=required` when missing Prism, authentication
  failure, or provider/model configuration failure should fail the command.
- Gito is opt-in because it may invoke `uvx`, use a cache outside the repo, and
  require LLM credentials or network access. Set `SD_AI_COMMAND_PACK_FULL_CHECK_GITO=1` to
  run it. Reports are written to `.build/review/gito` by default. When Gito
  reports a provider rate limit through an explicit HTTP 429 status such as
  `ClientError: 429`, the script retries with bounded exponential backoff.
- Prism and Gito review scans use the pack-managed standard exclusions for
  top-level AI/tooling/cache directories such as `.github/`, `.claude/`,
  `.codex/`, `.gemini/`, `.opencode/`, `.agents/`, `.build/`, `.git/`,
  `.pytest_cache/`, `.obsidian-kb/`, `.trellis/`, `.ruff_cache/`, `.venv/`,
  `.sd-ai-command-pack/`, and `node_modules/`.
- Prism scope is local-first to avoid redundant paid scans. When staged or
  unstaged changes exist, full-check reviews those distinct Git layers and
  defers the committed branch range until the tree is clean.
- If the script reports skipped checks, include those skips in the final report.

## Useful Environment Variables

Common toggles are below. See `docs/SD_AI_COMMAND_PACK.md` → Configuration for
the full set: base-ref discovery, package runner and script list, Prism rules
and threshold, Gito output directory and rate-limit retry tuning, PR-body config
paths, and deprecated fallbacks.

- On macOS, prefer a Homebrew Python-backed virtualenv for repo-local Python
  checks, especially coverage runs. Apple/Xcode Python often lacks project dev
  dependencies and can try to write bytecode caches under protected
  `~/Library/Caches` paths.
- In sandboxed agent sessions, set writable temp-backed caches before rerunning
  checks that fail while creating tool state: `PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX`,
  `UV_CACHE_DIR`, `UV_TOOL_DIR`, and `RUFF_CACHE_DIR`. The canonical
  copy/paste block lives in `docs/SD_AI_COMMAND_PACK.md` → Configuration.
- `SD_AI_COMMAND_PACK_FULL_CHECK_BASE_REF`: explicit base ref for branch review.
  When unset, the script discovers the remote default ref, then the branch
  upstream, then the first available remote ref.
- `SD_AI_COMMAND_PACK_FULL_CHECK_REVIEW_PREFLIGHT=0` / `=required`: skip the
  repo-local review preflight, or fail when no preflight command can run.
- `SD_AI_COMMAND_PACK_INSTALL_AUDIT=0`: skip the structural post-install audit.
- `SD_AI_COMMAND_PACK_INSTALL_AUDIT=required`: fail if the audit helper or
  `python3` is unavailable. By default those availability problems warn and
  continue.
- `SD_AI_COMMAND_PACK_FULL_CHECK_KB=0` / `=required`: skip the Obsidian KB
  freshness lane, or keep it read-only and fail when it cannot pass. Default
  `auto` checks only when a generated `.obsidian-kb/` folder exists; if stale
  output is already ignored, it refreshes once and requires a passing recheck.
  Missing `git` or unverifiable ignore state fails without refreshing.
- `SD_AI_COMMAND_PACK_FULL_CHECK_SKIP_PACKAGE_SCRIPTS=1`: skip all package-script
  checks.
- `SD_AI_COMMAND_PACK_FULL_CHECK_PRISM=0` / `=required`: skip Prism, or fail when
  Prism is missing, unauthenticated, or misconfigured.
- `SD_AI_COMMAND_PACK_FULL_CHECK_GITO=1`: run Gito review after Prism.
- `SD_AI_COMMAND_PACK_SCOPE_PR_BODY`: explicit PR body text for tooling/generated
  and PR-body scope checks in local or CI contexts where `gh pr view` should not
  be used.

## Expected Report

Report:

- Project checks: configured command or reported candidates, and which project
  checks actually ran.
- Pack full-check: whether deterministic checks passed.
- Optional AI review: whether Prism and Gito ran, skipped, or failed.
- Whether repo-local review preflight ran, skipped, or failed.
- Whether the post-install audit ran, skipped, or failed.
- Which package-script checks ran or were skipped.
- Whether Prism ran, skipped, found findings, lacked credentials, or had
  provider/model configuration failures.
- Whether Gito ran or was intentionally skipped, and where reports were written.
- Any command that failed and the smallest next fix.
