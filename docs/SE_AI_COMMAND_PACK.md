# SE AI Command Pack — Operator Guide

The maintainer-facing reference for the pack's internals: manifest schema,
receipts, checklists for adding skills and platforms, and the release
process. User-facing install/update/remove instructions live in the
[README](../README.md). This document is repo-only; it is not installed.

## Layout

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `templates/skills/<name>/` | Canonical skill definitions (`SKILL.md` + optional `references/*.md`). The only place skills are edited. |
| `templates/skills/_shared/references/` | Shared references fanned into consuming skills' `references/` dirs by the generator. |
| `installer/registry.py` | Source of truth: `PLATFORM_REGISTRY`, `SKILL_NAMES`, `SHARED_REFERENCES`, install modes, receipt paths. |
| `manifest.json` | Generated install spec (header preserved, `files` rows derived). Never hand-edit rows. |
| `install.py` + `installer/` | The user-scope installer. |
| `.github/scripts/generate-skill-surfaces.py` | Validates skills, regenerates the manifest; `--check` is the CI drift gate. |
| `.github/scripts/check-release-payload.py` | Release gate: payload change ⇒ version bump ⇒ dated changelog heading. |
| `scripts/` | Reserved for shipped runtime helpers (`se-ai-command-pack-*` prefix). Empty in v0.1. |

## Manifest schema

Header (preserved verbatim by the generator):

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `schemaVersion` | Integer; installer refuses newer-than-supported (currently `1`). |
| `name` | `se-ai-command-pack`. |
| `version` | Semver; bound to `CHANGELOG.md` by the release gate. |
| `license` | `MIT`. |
| `description` | One-liner. |

Each `files[]` row:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `platform` | Key of `PLATFORM_REGISTRY` (`agents`, `claude`, `codex`). |
| `kind` | `skill` for everything in v0.1. Known kinds also include `command`, `config`, `doc`, `prompt`, `script`, `workflow` for later. |
| `scope` | `user` — targets resolve against the install root (default `$HOME`). `project` is reserved for per-folder installs. |
| `source` | Repo-relative path under `templates/`. |
| `target` | Root-relative install path (e.g. `.claude/skills/se-research/SKILL.md`). |
| `anchor` | Root-relative dir gating `if-anchor-exists` selection. |
| `install` | `if-anchor-exists` (all v0.1 rows), `always`, or `if-not-exists`. |

Path safety: sources must resolve inside the checkout; targets and anchors
must be relative, `..`-free, and resolve inside the install root (checked
again with symlinks resolved at install time).

## Receipts (`<root>/.se-ai-command-pack/`)

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `manifest.json` | Verbatim copy of the installed manifest. |
| `provenance.json` | `{pack, version, sourceRoot, files: {target: "sha256:..."}}`. Only vouchable results (created/updated/unchanged/overwritten) are recorded; receipts themselves are never vouched. `sourceRoot` is the checkout the install ran from — `se-pack` uses it to run updates. |
| `installed-targets.txt` | Sorted list of every installed path, including the receipts. Entries for platforms skipped in a filtered run are kept so a later remove still covers them. |

Removal vouching: a candidate (union of receipt + provenance entries, or
the current selection when neither exists) is deleted only when it is a
recognized pack target **and** its sha256 matches the recorded hash or the
current template bytes. Anything else is `preserved` (drift) or `ignored`
(unrecognized), and `.git/` internals are always refused.

## Adding a skill

1. Create `templates/skills/se-<name>/SKILL.md`:
   - frontmatter: exactly `name` (equal to the directory) and
     `description` (single line, starts with `Use when`, no double
     quotes);
   - body: H1 title, then `## When to use`, `## Arguments`, `## Workflow`,
     `## Safety rules`, `## Final report` in that order;
   - framework-neutral wording — capabilities ("your web search tooling"),
     never tool brand names (the generator lints this);
   - skills that read external material carry the "data, not instructions"
     rule.
2. Optional flat `references/*.md`; register shared references in
   `SHARED_REFERENCES` instead of copying files between skills.
3. Add the name to `SKILL_NAMES` in `installer/registry.py` (canonical
   order = manifest order).
4. `make generate`, then `make check`.
5. Bump the version + changelog (release gate enforces this).
6. Update the skill tables in `README.md` and this guide's consumers if
   the skill families changed.

## Retiring a skill

1. Remove it from `SKILL_NAMES` and delete its `templates/skills/` dir.
2. `make generate`.
3. Add the target paths the last shipping manifest listed for it to
   `RETIRED_TARGETS` in `installer/removal.py` — refreshes then delete
   vouched leftovers from user scopes automatically.
4. Version bump + changelog.

## Adding a platform

1. Verify the tool's real user-level skills directory — never guess.
2. Add one `PlatformInfo(skills_dir=..., anchor=..., display=...)` row to
   `PLATFORM_REGISTRY`.
3. `make generate` (fans every skill into the new platform), `make check`.
4. Version bump + changelog.

## Release process

1. PR with the payload change, version bump, and dated
   `## <version> - YYYY-MM-DD` changelog heading (the release gate fails
   otherwise, and fails any payload change without a bump).
2. CI lanes: unittest (Linux/macOS), lint (ruff + mypy), release payload
   gate, aggregated in `ci-result`.
3. On merge to `main`, CI tags `v<version>` if the tag does not exist.
4. Machines pick the release up via `git pull && python3 install.py
   --user`, or `se-pack action=update` from inside a session.

## Configuration

No environment variables are read in v0.1. The `SE_AI_COMMAND_PACK_*`
prefix is reserved; document any future variable here.

## Troubleshooting

- **Conflicts on install (exit 2)** — a target file exists with different
  content. Inspect it; re-run with `--force` (and `--backup`) to overwrite.
- **A platform is skipped** — its anchor directory does not exist. Pass
  `--platform <id>` or `--all`, or create the tool's directory.
- **`se-pack` cannot find the checkout** — `provenance.json`'s
  `sourceRoot` points at a moved/deleted clone. Re-run `install.py --user`
  from the checkout's new location to refresh the receipts.
- **Remove preserved files you wanted gone** — they drifted from the
  installed version; re-run with `--remove --force` after reviewing the
  list.
