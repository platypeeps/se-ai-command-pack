# SE AI Command Pack

User-level knowledge-work skills for AI agent frameworks: personal profile
maintenance, pack discovery, deep research, claim fact-checking, decision
support, project-status reporting, daily briefs, meeting prep, landscape scans,
and document digests — installed once per machine, centrally managed from this
repository.

The pack borrows the installer architecture of its sibling
`sd-ai-command-pack` (manifest-driven payload, provenance receipts, vouched
removal, generated surfaces) but targets general knowledge work instead of
the software-delivery lifecycle, installs into **user-level** agent scopes
instead of per-repo adapters, and has no Trellis dependency.

## Skills

The catalog is grouped by each skill's primary outcome family. Descriptions
come directly from canonical skill frontmatter.

<!-- SE_SKILL_CATALOG:START -->
### Understand

| Skill | Use when |
|---|---|
| `se-research` | Use when the user asks for deep, multi-source research on a question or topic and wants a verified, source-graded written brief rather than a quick answer. |
| `se-scan` | Use when the user wants a competitive, market, or landscape scan that inventories the players in a space and compares them on consistent criteria. |
| `se-digest` | Use when the user provides multiple documents, threads, or links and wants them synthesized into one decision-ready brief with disagreements surfaced. |
| `se-fact-check` | Use when the user supplies claims or a draft and wants a claim-by-claim evidence audit with supported, partially supported, unverified, contradicted, or outdated verdicts. |

### Decide

| Skill | Use when |
|---|---|
| `se-decide` | Use when the user wants a defensible recommendation between known options using explicit criteria, constraints, evidence, tradeoffs, and uncertainty. |

### Coordinate

| Skill | Use when |
|---|---|
| `se-brief` | Use when the user asks for a morning, daily, or on-demand brief that assembles their stated topics and sources into one short, scannable update. |
| `se-meeting-prep` | Use when the user has an upcoming meeting or call and wants a dossier on the people, company, and context, plus talking points and questions. |
| `se-status` | Use when the user wants an objective-oriented project status update from supplied or connected work sources, with outcomes, current state, blockers, risks, decisions, asks, and next actions. |

### Operate

| Skill | Use when |
|---|---|
| `se-help` | Use when the user wants to discover, compare, or choose SE skills and receive a justified recommendation with a copy-ready prompt without executing another workflow. |
| `se-profile` | Use when the user wants to create, inspect, correct, review, import, export, or forget a consent-driven personal operating profile with traceable assertions. |
<!-- SE_SKILL_CATALOG:END -->

Skills that use external evidence share one quality bar: a
`source-standards.md` reference (source tiers, independence, dating,
confidence vocabulary) is installed into each consumer's `references/`
directory.

`se-profile` maintains a private, portable `se-personal-profile/v1` Markdown
artifact from explicit input and bounded user-authorized sources. The public
pack contains the schema and workflow only: profile content, locators,
credentials, and destination configuration remain private. Obsidian is the
preferred user-selected destination, with an explicit user-selected Notion
fallback; the skill implements no connector and never silently mirrors both.
Every mutation previews the change, preserves user-owned content, writes, reads
back, and verifies stable IDs. Any other skill that adopts the contract is a
read-only consumer and must never write back merely because it used the profile.

## What gets installed where

Skills are plain `SKILL.md` directories, installed into every platform
whose anchor directory exists in your home directory:

| Platform | Skills directory | Gating anchor | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `claude` | `~/.claude/skills/` | `~/.claude` | Claude Code / Cowork |
| `codex` | `~/.codex/skills/` | `~/.codex` | OpenAI Codex (honors `$CODEX_HOME`) |
| `agents` | `~/.config/agents/skills/` | `~/.config/agents` | Amp and compatible tools |

A platform whose anchor is missing is skipped with a hint; pass
`--platform <id>` or `--all` to install it anyway. Adding a platform is one
row in `installer/registry.py`.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/platypeeps/se-ai-command-pack.git
cd se-ai-command-pack
python3 install.py --user
```

Useful variants:

- `python3 install.py --user --dry-run` — show the plan without writing.
- `python3 install.py --user --platform codex` — one platform only.
- `python3 install.py --user --all` — install every platform, creating
  missing directories.

The installer is plan-before-apply: if any target file exists with
different content, it reports the conflicts and exits with code 2 without
writing anything. Re-run with `--force` to overwrite (add `--backup` to
keep `.bak` copies).

## Update

```sh
cd se-ai-command-pack
python3 install.py update --user --dry-run
python3 install.py update --user
```

The update command locates the checkout through the install receipt, refuses
a dirty worktree, pulls fast-forward only, previews the refreshed install,
then reapplies it from a fresh Python process.

Other lifecycle commands:

```sh
python3 install.py status --user
python3 install.py refresh --user --dry-run
python3 install.py refresh --user
```

## Remove

```sh
python3 install.py remove --user --dry-run
python3 install.py remove --user
```

Removal is vouched: a file is deleted only when its content matches the
recorded install hash or the current template. Files you have edited are
preserved and reported; `python3 install.py remove --user --force` deletes
them too. Empty parent
directories are pruned.

## How it works

- `templates/skills/<name>/` holds the canonical skill definitions — the
  only place skills are edited.
- `installer/registry.py` declares platforms, ordered skill-family metadata,
  outcome descriptions, and shared-reference fan-out; `make generate`
  regenerates `manifest.json`, this README's grouped catalog, and the versioned
  `se-help` catalog from one frontmatter parse.
- `install.py` owns the pack lifecycle and applies the manifest to your home directory (or `--root`
  elsewhere) and writes receipts under `~/.se-ai-command-pack/`:
  - `manifest.json` — copy of the installed manifest (version lookup);
  - `provenance.json` — sha256 per installed file plus `sourceRoot`, the
    checkout path updates run from;
  - `installed-targets.txt` — every installed path, the removal record.
- CI gates: the manifest must match the generated surfaces, and any payload
  change must bump the version with a dated `CHANGELOG.md` heading.

## Maintaining the pack

1. Edit or add skills under `templates/skills/` (see
   [docs/SE_AI_COMMAND_PACK.md](docs/SE_AI_COMMAND_PACK.md) for the
   add-a-skill checklist).
2. `make generate` to refresh the manifest, README catalog, and bundled
   `se-help` catalog reference.
3. For shipped payload changes, bump `version` in `manifest.json` and add the
   matching `CHANGELOG.md` heading. Metadata-only catalog changes do not need a
   release bump when generated payload bytes stay unchanged.
4. `make check` (tests, lint, release gates), then PR.
5. `make sync` to dogfood the result into your own home directory.

## Repository map

The generated [Repomix repository map](docs/repomix-map.md) provides a compact,
AI-friendly view of the repository. Refresh it after structural or substantial
documentation changes:

```sh
make repomix
```

The refresh script runs the pinned Repomix version through `npx`; Node.js and
`npx` are required, but no Node dependencies are installed into this Python
project.

## Non-goals in v0.1 (designed-for, not built)

- **Per-folder installs** — the manifest already carries a `scope` field
  and the installer a `--root`; a future `project` scope slots in without a
  schema break.
- **Plugin/marketplace packaging** — a build step can emit a plugin layout
  from the same `templates/skills/` source; that is the path to cloud
  sessions whose home directory is not this machine's.
- **Command surfaces** (per-platform command/prompt adapters) — the
  generator keeps the sd-pack fan-out pattern available if skills alone
  stop being enough.
- **A workflow backbone** — `preflight_checks()` in `install.py` is the
  single seam where a future backend prerequisite would land.
